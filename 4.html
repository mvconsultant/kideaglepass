1-2-2020: Today I will continue reading JS 1:
This section will teach me how to build a web page using HTML, which is simply text written a certain way so your browser can read it as a set of instructions.
In HTML, we call each instruction a HTML tag.
Tags consist of the tag name surrounded by angle brackets, namely the < and > characters.
e.g. <h1> is a tag with tag name h1.
Some tags do not require an closing tag or content:
<input type="text"/>
<br/>
Here's an example of how to write an h1 tag.
<h1> This is a header line 1</h1>
Both <h1> and </h1> are HTML tags
<h1> is called the opening tag whereas </h1> is called the closing tag.
h1 is the tagname.
Note: h1 is a header tag and is usually the title of the HTML page. It has the largest text on the page. There are 6 header tags: h1 to h6.
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
An example of a tag that does not require content. The end tag is not required.
<input type="text" />
The input tag tells the browser to display an input box that the user can type into.
How to follow along:
First, create a file with your favorite text editor and make sure the file name ends with a .html (eg. index.html). Write the following example into your file and save:
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<input />
HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag:
<tagname>Content</tagname>
Make sure you understand the difference between tags (<h1> ) and elements (the instructions that are displayed to the user).
When you open an HTML file with a browser, the browser reads and interprets the HTML instruction (elementsO and then displayes the resulting web page.
HTML Example
Here is an example of 7 HTML tags.
Create a new HTML file, call it challenge1html, open it in your browser, and try to match each tag instruction with its corresponding element!
(Note that we're getting you started on a later exercise, which you will write HTML instructions for Challenge 1 from the previous lesson.)

I typed the html code and the elements displayed on the browser.
Attributes:
Notice that in the above example, input tags are different from the rest. They have type="text".
These are called attributes.
Attributes provide more information about the tag to the browser.
For example above, try changing the value of the input tag's type attribute from text to password, number, or file and see what happens (make sure to type into the input tag).
<input type="password">
<input type="number">
<input type "file">
