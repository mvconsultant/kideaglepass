Tags can have multiple attributes and they are written in this format:
<tagName attribute1="attribute1 value" attribute2="attribute2 value" ...> content </tagName>
For example, 
<input class="c1input1" type="text" />
The input tag has 2 attributes, class and type.
type tells the browser what type of input box to display <number, text, file, password etc.).
                        The class attribute will be covered in the section below.  
Browser JavaScript
So far the web pages we've written have been static- the browser renders (displays) the page once, then doesn't interact with us after that. The sites you're used to probably have more interesting behavior. This is often done with JavaScript. JavaScript is used to manipulate the HTML elements on a page after the page has been rendered, depending on lots of factors such as what the user does, how much time has gone by, or even information the page receives from other websites.
This is called dynamic behavior. To get started, we'll add a script tag, which tells the browser to treat the text inside as JavaScript and run the code.
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>JS0</h2>
<h5>Challenge 1</h5>
<input type="text" />
<input type="text" />
<button>Submit</button>
<hr>
    <script>
      alert<("Hello")
    </script>
    
When you put the above HTML into your file and reload it in your browser, you will notice a popup. This popup is created when the browser runs the alert JavaScript function.
